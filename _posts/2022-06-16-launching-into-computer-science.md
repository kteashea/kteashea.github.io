## Launching into Computer Science - June 2022

This post is meant to summarize some of the key concepts I have learned in the course *Introduction to Python*

To do:
A page for each module, which will include
A summary of the learning outcomes of the module
The artefacts created during the module, including a brief description of each one and any feedback received
A reflective piece (What exactly have I learnt and how?)
Meeting notes (from various meetings with team members and tutor, where applicable). 
Professional skills matrix and action plan (What skills have I gained or enhanced as a result of this module and how can I use it?)

### Learning Outcomes


## Unit 1: Computing as a Profession – Responsibilities and Challenges

###Computer Science Career I want to Pursue
 I am currently working as an educator. I am a middle and high school technology teacher. I wish to increase my knowledge of computer science, in particular developing more advanced programming skills. 


####Essential:
- Have a broad knowledge of computer science careers,
- Knowledge about various coding languages,
- Understand the ethics behind computer science,
- Ability to create authentic learning experiences for my students


####Desirable:
- Complete a Post-Graduate Certification in Computer Science or continue complete a Post-Graduate Diploma in Computer Science,
- Be very well versed in multiple programming languages,
- Gain ability to create tools which I can use in my own class,
- Gain coding skills which can help me extend beyond teaching.

###Reviewing my organization's IT Code of Conduct: 
I work in a private international school located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I am currently a technology teacher and facilitator for middle and high school. My role is mainly educational technology related but I work closely with the IT department to help create various IT policies. 

  Within our organization, we have several safeguards to ensure the protection and management of data. Our school network devices have antivirus licences, security maintenance, run a daily back-up and have a standard firewall policy/security set up. Our internet also has a firewall set-up which differs for each type of user: student, teacher, or guest. We have an open-source software called Gibbon where our student records and data are stored. Each staff has different access levels based on their roles within the school (administration, academic staff, support staff). We are using an SSO (Single-Sign-On) method that enables the users to securely log-on and authenticate by using one set of credentials. All members of staff have a school email account and all school related data is stored on a shared Google Drive which is only accessed using the school specific account (CISP, 2021). 

	The school collects and stores various forms of personal data from both the students and teachers, including name, address, academic records, medical records, employment history (of staff and parents), and so forth. We follow the concept of consent, all parents must give consent for the school to collect and store data. Teachers also consent to having their data being collected and stored (European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, 2019).
  
  When it comes to digital security, there have been no incidents in terms of data breaching or cyber attacks. The greatest concern the school has is the “human factor” (Richardson et al., 2020). Schools have a lot of sensitive as well as valuable data and it can be a safety concern if it is leaked. Students and teachers are not always well-versed when it comes to cyber security and avoiding attacks such as phishing or downloading malware (Brookshear, Brookshear, Brylow, 2019). Uneducated users, both students and teachers, can lead to weaknesses in the school’s cyber security which can lead to a cyber crime taking place (Richardson et al., 2020). 
  
  An area of improvement is educating both the employees as well as the students. I teach all of the middle school and high school students in the school and I run classes in digital citizenship where I teach students to recognize cyber security threats. However, there is no training for the elementary students or teachers. Especially teachers, who have access to the most sensitive of data must be given cyber security training, so they can be more aware and vigilant (Richardson et al., 2020). As a computing professional, this is a part of my responsibility. I should be running training and helping others to increase their awareness.
